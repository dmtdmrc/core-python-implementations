# core-python-implementations

## Overview
This repository contains a small Python project focused on implementing and testing core functions in a1.py.

The code is structured to work with a1_test.py, which runs a set of predefined unit tests.

The project was developed for personal learning and experimentation, focusing on:

* Working with Python modules
* Function implementation and debugging
* Using automated tests to validate code correctness
  
No external datasets or frameworks are required beyond basic Python libraries.

## Dependencies

To run the tests locally, the following Python packages are required:

`numpy`
`torch`
